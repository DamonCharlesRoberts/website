I project outcomes by fitting models on data, build webapplications, and am learning to manage databases better.

My academic research is featured in a number of peer-reviewed academic journals such as *Political Behavior*, *Political Research Quarterly*, *Social Science Quarterly*, and *American Politics Research*. My public-facing work has also been featured in *The Washington Post*'s Monkey Cage Blog (now *Good Authority*).
