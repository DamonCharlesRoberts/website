Today I took over for a Survey Methods class and also taught my Applied Research Methods class. 

Since it was halloween, I decided that I'd bring some candy.

I had a bag of 50 pieces that offered an even assortment of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, KitKat, Hershey's Milk Chocolate, and Almond Joy.

I decided I'd look to see how popular each candy was among the students. Here is a distribution of the proportion of candies when all was said and done.

Maybe the kids are alright after all.
