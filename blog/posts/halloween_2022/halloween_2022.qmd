Today I took over for a Survey Methods class and also taught my Applied Research Methods class. 

Since it was halloween, I decided that I'd bring some candy.

I had a bag of 50 pieces that offered an even assortment of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, KitKat, Hershey's Milk Chocolate, and Almond Joy.

I decided I'd look to see how popular each candy was among the students. Here is a distribution of the proportion of candies when all was said and done.

```{r}
#| label: setup-block

box::use(
    tibble = tibble[tibble],
    dplyr = dplyr[mutate, select],
    ggplot2 = ggplot2[...],
    grid = grid[rasterGrob]
)
```

```{r}
#| label: create-table
total <- 50
kit_kat_total <- 50/4
hershey_total <- 50/4
reese_total <- 50/4
almond_joy_total <- 50/4
kit_kat <- 5
hershey <- 12
reese <- 1
almond_joy <- 1
```

```{r}
#| label: calculate-proportions

candy_prop <- tibble(
        `Candy` = c("Almond Joy", "Reese's", "Hershey's Milk Chocolate", "Kit Kat"),
        `Proportion Remaining` = c((almond_joy/almond_joy_total), (reese/reese_total), (hershey/hershey_total), (kit_kat/kit_kat_total))
)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-candy-pop
#| fig-cap: Popularity of Candy (proportion remaining)

costumes_plot_orange_background <- png::readPNG("costumes-plot-orange-background.png")

candy_prop |>
    ggplot() +
        annotation_custom(rasterGrob(costumes_plot_orange_background, width = unit(1, "npc"), height = unit(1, "npc")), -Inf, Inf, -Inf, Inf) +
        geom_col(aes(x = `Candy`, y = `Proportion Remaining`), fill = "#000000", position = "dodge", width = .75, colour = 'black') +
        labs(caption = 'Credit: @damoncroberts')
```

Maybe the kids are alright after all.
