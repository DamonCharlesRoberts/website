# Basics of R syntax {#sec-r-basics}

Okay, now we can start learning about the basics of the R coding syntax.

R is a programming *language*. This means just as you would with learning anyother language, you need to immerse yourself into it by practicing and getting your hands dirty. No one knows everything about the R coding language. You learn it over time and with more experience.

Coding in general can be very frustrating. Even for experienced coders (I would count myself as one of them -- I know quite a few coding languages and even know a lot of theory behind coding languages and get pretty frustrated at times). But with more practice, you get more and more used to it. 

You should not approach coding simply as memorizing what to type. It also requires a different type of thinking and workflow. What I mean by this is that coding is logical. Your computer is dumb. Coding is telling your computer what to do, step by step. This means that code needs to follow a particular order and you need to be exact. Many people get frustrated and overwhelmed when they are just staring at a blank script file. You need to first think about what end result you want and need to work backwards from that. Sometimes, if I am stuck, I just start drawing or writing an outline that starts with the end result I want and I start writing backwards what steps need to be done to get there. Additionally, you can't memorize everything. This means that you will have a lot of times where you are troubleshooting bugs in code. There is no central repository of coding information (including me). When coding, you need to get in the habit of looking up answers for how to do something or how to fix a bug with Google. I did not get this good at coding because I have someone to ask coding questions to. I became good at coding because I learned how to find resources and documentation for how to do these things myself. The common joke is that a coder needs one screen to write their code and about 20 others to display all of the Google Chrome tabs that they have open. This is *very* true. 

So... my advice is: 

- accept the fact that you will get frustrated during the process of writing your code; but trust me, once you have your end result, you'll be satisfied. 
- if you want to develop some independence and really understand what your code does, don't fall into the habit of immediately asking instructors/friends/classmates/etc. to help diagnose an error or to explain the code. Hop on to google and start searching around. 
    - This will be less successful and meaningful in the beginning, but over time, you'll start to understand what to look for, how, and how to understand some of the jargon in some of these resources over time. Again, this is part of the skillset to develop.

Okay... finally, some basics of R code.

## Commenting

- Denoted with `#` in a  `.qmd` code chunk or your `.R`
- R does not evaluate this. So comments can be written in natural language
- Used to explain what the code:
    - is doing
    - notes for yourself or teammates
    - help explain and document your code for the future
- **You must document your code**
    - This is really important. Don't just write the code, comment different parts to explain what it is doing
- Pick a consistent commenting strategy and stick with it
    - Some people only use `#` to add comments to their code.
    - My personal preference is to write my comments like a bulleted list.

```{{r}}
#| label: one-plus-one
# Notes:
    #* Description: R script to add one to one
    #* Updated: 2023-01-01
        #** by: dcr

# Calculate 1+1
1+1
```

Notice, that I don't use `#|`. This is because `#|` is a special thing in a `.qmd` code chunk to specify options. I instead use `#` to represent headers and `#*` for subheaders in my comments. This allows me to create a bulleted-list-type set of comments that are pretty easy to read and to also follow for teammates.

## Objects

**`Objects` represent the temporarily stored (cached) result of any operation/function in R**.

You define objects with the `assignment operator` (`<-`).

Here is an example:


Say that I want to evaluate the expression $1+1$. But say I want to access the result of that expression later. Either because I don't want to rerun the code or if I want to store the result and do some other things to it later. 

I can create an `object` to store the result of me evaluating the expression $1+1$. R stores this object in your `environment` (see @sec-anatomy) and will stay accessible to you until you close out of RStudio.

```{r}
# Define a = 1+1
a <- 1+1
```

So with the code chunk above, what does a represent?

Let's check:

```{r}
print(a)
```

Now let's say that I want to evaluate the expression $1+1+1$ later in my code. But I already evaluated part of this expression with $1+1$! Since I stored the result in `a`, I can just evaluate the expression $a+1$ which is equivalent to $1+1+1$.

```{r}
# Evaluate a+1
b <- a+1
```

We should expect that $b=3$:
```{r}
print(b)
```

### Functions

Functions are a specific type of object.

Functions are simply an object that takes an `input` and does something to that `input`. R is full of functions. 

Some examples of `functions` that we have already dealt with:

- `<-`: The input is the `object` and the name you want to assign the `object`
- `+`: The input are the numbers you want to sum

Functions more generally are predefined with underlying code (often *very* complex) that do some task for you. They are a shortcut so that you don't have to rewrite that same code. Otherwise, everyone's scripts would be *much* longer than they are. 

As `functions` are a specific type of object, the whole idea behind a function is to only need to write the code once; rather than multiple times throughout a script. 

We can write our own `functions` (advanced topic we aren't going to go over), and we can access the `functions` written by other people to make our life easier. 

When someone writes a `function` and want to share it, they often have other related `functions` and code. They can `package` all of this code into a `library` and submit it to code repositories such as `Github` or `CRAN` (where you downloaded R; because what you downloaded came with basic functions like `+` and `<-`).

If there is a `function` that someone has written and `package`d, you will need to install the underlying code onto your computer so that you can use it for your own work. 

#### Installing packages

To install a package from `CRAN` (often the default place to download packages from), you can use the built-in `function` `install.packages()`

```{{r}}
# Install some package called FakePackage
install.packages("FakePackage")

# Install some package called FakePackage and another called OtherPackage
install.packages(c("FakePackage", "OtherPackage"))
```

The `install.package()` `function` takes an input -- the name of the package you want to install (surrounded by parenthases) -- and it will then perform some action with that input -- download the underlying code for that package and function. 

:::{.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Note:** The input for this and other functions **ARE case-sensitive**.

For example, if I ran the following instead:

```{{r}}
install.packages("fakepackage")
```

I would get an error!

#### Loading packages

Now, how do I use my function?

Well, you've downloaded the `package` containing the `function` that you want to use, but you will need to now load it to your `environment`. Why? Well, again, remember that `functions` are just a type of `object`. More practically, think about the number of packages some one like me has on my computer. If everytime I opened R, it automatically loaded *all* of that code, then my computer would probably melt. So instead, I just want to specify what I want to load.

There are a couple of options:
1. Most people load the *entire* package by writing:
```{{r}}
# Load packages
library(FakePackage) # load FakePackage
```
2. Modularly loading only the functions you want from your packages:
```{{r}}
# Load packages
box::use(
    FakePackage = FakePackage[FunctionIWant, OtherFunctionIWant], # Load FunctionIWant and OtherFunctionIWant in FakePackage
    OtherPackage = [...] # load all functions in OtherPackage
)
```
What are the benefits of the second option?

- I load only the functions that I actually am going to use
- Sometimes functions can be named the samething, do different things, and are from different packages. This can create a lot of confusion and can even lead to errors in R if R is confused about what to use. Loading things purposefully, you can identify all of this before you try to run it.
- Puts less strain on my computer
- Easier to read. Now I can see what functions I got from which package rather than it just loading everything from the packages I loaded with `library()`

To use one of the two options:

- Using `library()`: No extra steps, `library()` comes with R when you downloaded it -- from the base-r package (technically)
- Using `box::use()`: Need to install the `box` package. And then you can just use the code from above! 

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("box")
```
